# Photovoltaic Energy Production Forecast

Trabajo Fin de Grado: Predicción mediante redes neuronales de la producción de energía de un parque fotovoltaico.

## Summary

This Final Degree Project is a study about the forecast of energy production of a photovoltaic farm. In order to carry out the simulation a farm has been chosen located in Monteroni di Lecce (Italy), whose nominal power is 960 kW.
Different models based on neural networks have been developed as well as a mathematical model, with the goal of forecasting the energy produced in the photovoltaic farm with the least error. For the development of the neural networks has been necessary a large data base that collects diverse meteorological and technical parameters of the photovoltaic farm.
